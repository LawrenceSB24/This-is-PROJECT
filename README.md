## User-story

So Im trying to get a basic functioning website for fetching hiking trails to work.

AS A tourist
I want to be able to find hiking locations
BASED On my unique search criteria
SO THAT I can be an informed hiker for my desired trip

I was going to put acceptance criteria but the main goal for this repo is to get the fetch api function to work properly.
